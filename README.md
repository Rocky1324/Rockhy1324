## Hackathons

### 🎵 [Harmony Hub – No JavaScript Web Challenge (Hackathon 2025)](https://github.com/Rocky1324/music-web-css-only)
A pure HTML & CSS project built for a **No JavaScript Web Design Hackathon**.  
Focused on creativity, accessibility, and CSS-only interactivity (including a dark mode toggle).

**Highlights:**
- Built entirely without JavaScript — animations, transitions, and interactions powered by CSS only  
- Implemented a fully responsive layout and dark mode toggle using `:checked` selector  
- Learned advanced CSS techniques: gradients, animations, and semantic HTML  

**Inspiration:**  
Music connects people across cultures — this project celebrates that connection through design and code.
